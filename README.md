# [Simple Touch](https://github.com/gregstewart/simple-touch)

This is completely based of the [Zepto.js touch library] (https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/blob/master/src/touch.js)
, I just picked it apart, applied our coding standards to it and wrapped some Jasmine tests around it, while trying to
understand how it was built and what it did.
